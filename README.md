### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Stefano, a Software Engineer from Sicily (Italy) who is now living and working in Scotland (UK).

I am passionate about software development, machine learning, and scientific research. I love learning, I enjoy working with new technologies, and I often contribute to open source software.

I received my BSc with Honours in Applied Computing in June 2019 at the University of Stirling. For my 4th year dissertation, I used machine learning to analyse messages on social media to determine whether it is feasible to detect criminal or anti-social behaviour.

I am currently working as a Junior Software Engineer at WRLD3D.
